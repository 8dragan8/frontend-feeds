## Front-end Feeds (WORK IN PROGRESS!)

An up to date list of RSS feeds for front-end developers.

This list is a modern take on [Paul Irish's now out-of-date list of feeds](http://www.paulirish.com/2011/web-browser-frontend-and-standards-feeds-to-follow/). I've taken the most relevant feeds from his list and created a new feeds list.

Despite the death of Google Reader, I still use RSS regularly (I use [NewsBlur](http://newsblur.com)), and I think lots of others in the industry do too &mdash; but probably not as frequently as we used to.

The feeds list is divided into three sections:

1. Must-reads
2. Secondary Reads
3. Weeklies and Dailies

You'll probably notice that a lot of stuff you expect to see here is missing. I've excluded certain blogs from this list for one or more of the following reasons:

* The blog hasn't been updated in a long time
* Posts are very infrequent (e.g. 2 per year)
* Too many personal posts that have nothing to do with web development

## Suggestions?
As stated above, I'm still working on this and I'm happy to take suggestions, even if it's your own feed. I know I'm missing lots of good stuf, especially newer stuff that I'm probably not as familiar with, and probably a lot on performance and tooling.

So please contribute by commenting, opening an issue, or by submitting a pull request.
