# Front-end Feeds (Work in Progress!)

An up to date list of RSS feeds for front-end developers.

This list is a modern take on [Paul Irish's now out-of-date list of feeds](http://www.paulirish.com/2011/web-browser-frontend-and-standards-feeds-to-follow/). I've taken the most relevant feeds from his list and created a new feeds list.

Despite the death of Google Reader, I still use RSS regularly (I use [NewsBlur](http://newsblur.com)), and I think lots of others in the industry do too &mdash; but probably not as frequently as we used to.

The feeds list is divided into five sections:

1. Must-reads
2. Great to Read
3. Dailies and Weeklies
4. Feedception (News lists, link lists, etc.)
5. Q&A (Stack Overflow, etc.)

You'll probably notice that a lot of stuff you expect to see here is missing. I've excluded certain websites from this list for one or more of the following reasons:

* The blog/site hasn't been updated in a long time
* Posts are very infrequent (e.g. 2 per year or fewer)
* Too many personal posts that have nothing to do with web development
* Too many sponsored posts and other non-desirables

## Suggestions?
As stated above, I'm still working on this and I'm happy to take suggestions, even if it's your own feed. I know I'm missing lots of good stuff, especially newer stuff that I'm probably not as familiar with, and probably a lot on performance and tooling.

So please contribute by commenting, opening an issue, or by submitting a pull request.

For reference the list is provided below, with an equivalent OPML file in the repo, for importing into your feed reader.

## The Feeds

[soon...]

I'd also like to include the following feeds, but they have no RSS feed, or they are WordPress categories that have no category feed:

<ul>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/category/css-2">http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/category/css-2</a></li>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/category/javascript-2">http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/category/javascript-2</a></li>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/category/html5-2">http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/category/html5-2</a></li>
</ul>
